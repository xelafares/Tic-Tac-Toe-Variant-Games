# Tic-Tac-Toe-Variant-Games
A bunch of Tic-Tac-Toe games with different variants.

How to play:

1- Pyramic Tic-Tac-Toe
The game board is shaped like a pyramid. Five squares make the base, then three, then one. Players
take turns marking Xs and Os as in traditional tic-tac-toe. Winning: The first player to get three-in-a-row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

2- Word Tic-tac-toe
Word Tic-tac-toe is an innovative twist on the classic Tic-tac-toe game. Instead of using "X" or "O", players place
letters on a 3x3 grid to form valid words. This version adds a linguistic challenge to the traditional game mechanics. 
Players aim to form a valid word with the letters they place on the board. Words can be formed horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally. 
+ Rules: Each player takes turns placing one letter on the board. A player must try to form a valid word with each
move. Players can build upon existing letters to form words, provided that the resulting sequence is
a valid word. 
+ Winning: The game is won by forming a valid word horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board fills up without
a valid word being formed, the game ends in a draw.
+Additional Details: A file named dic.txt will be provided, containing all valid 3-letter words.

3- Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is an expansion of the classic game, where players engage in a meta-game of Tic Tac Toe 
within a 3x3 grid of smaller Tic Tac Toe boards. The goal is to win three smaller games in a row to claim victory
on the main board, adding layers of complexity to the traditional game. The game is played ona large 3x3 grid, 
where each cell contains a smaller 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board.
+ Rules: Player 1 starts by choosing any of the nine smaller Tic Tac Toe boards to play on. Players alternate turns, 
playing Tic Tac Toe on the smaller boards. The winner of each smaller board claims that space on the main board. The
winner of the smaller board replaces that board with their symbol (X or O) on the main board. 
+ Winning: The first player to win three smaller boards in a row on the main 3x3 grid wins the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.
The winning row on the main board can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
